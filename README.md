# Bootstrap-business-site

Bootstrap business site. This site was created as recruitment task for adRespect
agency. Layout belongs to the agency but code is mine.

I use:

1. Bootstrap 5.3.1
2. Masonry layout 4.2.2 (images grid layout for projects gallery)
3. imagesLoaded script (JS plugin to resolve images overlaping)
4. Glightbox (JS plugin to add modal for images)

Site was created mostly for iPhone, iPad and bigger resolutions.
